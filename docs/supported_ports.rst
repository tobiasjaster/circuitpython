Supported Ports
==============================

CircuitPython supports a number of microcontroller families. Support quality for each varies
depending on the active contributors for each port.

Adafruit sponsored developers are actively contributing to atmel-samd, mimxrt10xx, nordic,
raspberrypi, and stm ports.
They also maintain the other ports in order to ensure the boards build.
Additional testing is limited.
