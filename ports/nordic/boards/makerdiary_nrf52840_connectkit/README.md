# Makerdiary nRF52840 Connect Kit

## Introduction

[nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit) is an open-source prototyping
kit designed for connected projects. It is built using the nRF52840 SoC, which has protocol support for
Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary stacks. It provides
Arm TrustZoneÂ® CryptoCell cryptographic unit as well as numerous peripherals such as USB 2.0, NFC-A, GPIO,
UART, SPI, TWI, PDM, I2S, QSPI, PWM, ADC, QDEC to support a wide range of applications.

The design is available in an easy-to-use form factor with USB-C and 40 pin DIP/SMT type, including up to
32 multi-function GPIO pins (7 can be used as ADC inputs) and Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port. It features
RGB LED, Buttons, external 64 Mbit QSPI flash and flexible power management with various options for easily
powering the unit from USB-C, external supplies or batteries, and also has Chip antenna and U.FL receptacle
options to support various wireless scenarios.
